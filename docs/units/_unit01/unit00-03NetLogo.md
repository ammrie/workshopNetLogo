The model cooperation is useful for the context of education for sustainable development. Although it is an ecological model is allows insights useful for human-environment systems.

### NetLogo Model Cooperation
The cooperation model works according to the basic rule:

* the cows eat grass in the field they are in and get energy from it
* if they have enough energy, they reproduce
* if they don't have enough energy they die
* they advance to a new grass field after each time step
* the grass grows back; half-grown grass faster than grass that has been completely eaten away
* There are sustainable cows (cooperative cows) and greedy cows (greedy cows)
* the cooperative cows only eat tall grass and eat up to half of it
* the greedy cows eat both tall and semi-tall grass

### Use the model
Try to answer the following questions by adjusting the settings of the model world using the sliders:

* how many sustainably raised cows can live on the pasture
* how many cows in non-sustainable husbandry fit on the pasture
* which cows in mixed housing dominate in the short term and which cows dominate in the long term
* what do you think is the best result? Why?
