### Use the model
Try to answer the following questions by adjusting the settings of the model world using the sliders:

* How many cooperative cows can live on the pasture?
* How many greedy cows fit on the pasture?
* Which cows in mixed housing dominate in the short term, and which cows dominate in a long time?
* What do you think is the best result you can yield with the model? Why?

### Understand the model
Try to understand how the model works, and read the model info section to access the fundamental ideas.

*	What is the difference between greedy and cooperative cows?
*	Under which conditions does each of the breeds benefit? Why?
*	What properties do the patches - the land fields of the model - have?

Prepare to present your model to your peers in a max of 5 minutes. You may cooperate with other groups working on the same model.

### Interpreting the model
To become scientifically literate, students should learn to:

* identify questions
* acquire new knowledge
* explain scientific phenomena
* draw evidence-based conclusions

In consideration of these aims, please think about:

* A real-world scenario, the model can be interpreted for.
* An according research question that can be investigated by applying the model.
* The knowledge gained by applying the model.
* The evidence this knowledge is based on.

Prepare to present your considerations to your peers in a max of 5 minutes. You may cooperate with other groups working on the same model.
