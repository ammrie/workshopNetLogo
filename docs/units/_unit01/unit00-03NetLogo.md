### Use the model
Try to answer the following questions by adjusting the settings of the model world using the sliders:

* How many cooperative cows can live on the pasture?
* How many greedy cows fit on the pasture?
* Which cows in mixed housing dominate in the short term and which cows dominate in the long term?
* What do you think is the best result you can yield with the model? Why?

### Understand the model
Try to understand how the model works, read the *model info* section to get access to the fundamental ideas. 

* What is the difference between greedy and cooperative cows?
* Under which conditions does each of the breeds benefit? Why?
* What properties do the patches - the land fields of the model - have?

Prepare yourselfes to present your model to your peers in max 5 minutes you may cooperate with other groups working on the same model. 

### Interpreting the model
To become scientific literate students should learn to:
* identify questions
* acquire new knowledge
* explain scientific phenomena 
* draw evidence-based conclusions 

In consideration of these aims, please think about: 
* A real world scenario the model can be interpreted for. 
* An according research question that can be investigate by applying the model.
* The knowlegde gained by applying the model.
* The evidence this knowledge is based on.
