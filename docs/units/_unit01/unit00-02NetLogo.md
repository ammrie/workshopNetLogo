### Use the model
Try to answer the following questions by adjusting the settings of the model world using the sliders:

* How does sedimentation impact the formation of meanders?
* How does erosion impact the formation of meanders?
* Can you delay the formation of meanders? Try to maximize the delay.
* What is the maximum sinuosity? 

### Understand the model
Try to understand how the model works, and read the model info section to access the fundamental ideas.

* How does the erosion process start?
* Why do the meanders become bigger and bigger?
* Why is there a maximum for the sinuosity? 


Prepare to present your model to your peers in a max of 5 minutes. You may cooperate with other groups working on the same model.

### Interpreting the model
To become scientifically literate, students should learn to:

* identify questions
* acquire new knowledge
* explain scientific phenomena
* draw evidence-based conclusions

In consideration of these aims, please think about:

* A real-world scenario, the model can be interpreted for.
* An according research question that can be investigated by applying the model.
* The knowledge gained by applying the model.
* The evidence this knowledge is based on.

Prepare to present your considerations to your peers in a max of 5 minutes. You may cooperate with other groups working on the same model.
