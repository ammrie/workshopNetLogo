### NetLogo software
During this workshop you can work with the embedded web-version of NetLogo (see following pages). If you want to continue working with NetLogo you can download the free software [here](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.2.0/) and install it.

This [Tutorial](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/tutorial1.html) is helpful as a comprehensive starter, you don't need it for this workshop but might want to look at it late. If you want to go ahead and understand the code the [NetLogo Dictionary](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html) and the [beginner's guide to NetLogo programming](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/bind/) will be helpful.
