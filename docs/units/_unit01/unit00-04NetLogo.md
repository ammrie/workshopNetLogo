### Use the model

Try to answer the following questions by adjusting the settings of the model world using the sliders:

* How similar are the neighborhoods in average and percentage depending on the slider similarity-wanted?
* How does the initial occupancy density affect the time for the model to finish? 
* Can you set sliders so that the model never finishes running and agents keep looking for new locations? 
* Which slider setup minimizes the time until all agents are happy?
* How do the segregation patterns vary when changing the sliders occupancy density and the similarity-wanted?

### Understand the model
Try to understand how the model works, and read the model info section to access the fundamental ideas.

* When are the agents happy?
* When do they move?
* Why does the density impact the segregation patterns?

Prepare to present your model to your peers in a max of 5 minutes. You may cooperate with other groups working on the same model.

### Interpreting the model
To become scientifically literate, students should learn to:

* identify questions
* acquire new knowledge
* explain scientific phenomena
* draw evidence-based conclusions

In consideration of these aims, please think about:

* A real-world scenario, the model can be interpreted for.
* An according research question that can be investigated by applying the model.
* The knowledge gained by applying the model.
* The evidence this knowledge is based on.

Prepare to present your considerations to your peers in a max of 5 minutes. You may cooperate with other groups working on the same model.
