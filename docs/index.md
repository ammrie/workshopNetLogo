## Welcome to the NetLogo Workshop!
In this workshop I will introduce some methods I teach in Germany. I am looking forward to discuss their potential for the Polish context. This is a first trail, so let's see how this exchange works for all of us and what kind of international cooperation we could benefit from in the future.  


## Overview 
The workshop will integrate input, discussion and hands-on activity. There will be a focus on international exchange on geography education and an introduction to a computer-based approach to modeling. The workshop will take 2 x 2.15 hours. 

## Goals
At the end of the workshop you:
* know the approach of modeling systems in geography education and can refelect on its relevance for polish educational goals
* can handle the NetLogo interface and use models from the NetLogo library
* are able to refelct on NetLogos potential for a Geography lessons

I hope you enjoy! If there any questions later on, feel free to contact me.
